# Bogtris

**This is not affiliated with Tetris in any way, and should be viewed as purely educational.**

This is a HTML5 clone of Tetris. Includes SRS spins, back-to-back bonuses, comboes, and battle modes. Bots implemented with genetic algorithms.

## Setup

Express is used to host the app server (at `index.js`), although any web server can work (just point to `public/index.html`).

PIXI.js and Howler.js includes are already included.
